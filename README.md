# Kaggle Competition: Predicting Survival Outcomes after Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HCT)

## Competition Objective
The goal of this competition is to predict the survival status of patients after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT). This is a binary classification task, where:
- **Target Variable**: Whether the patient survives within a specific time period (Survived/Not Survived).
- **Data Types**: Clinical features, genetic data, treatment plans, and other related variables.

## Task Breakdown
To systematically approach this competition, tasks are categorized as follows:

### 1. Data Exploration and Cleaning
#### Objective:
- Understand the data structure (e.g., number of columns, types, missing value distribution).
- Clean and standardize the dataset.

#### Specific Tasks:
- Identify and handle missing or anomalous values.
- Encode categorical variables (e.g., one-hot encoding).
- Normalize/standardize numerical variables.

### 2. Feature Engineering
#### Objective:
- Extract meaningful features from existing data to enhance model performance.

#### Specific Tasks:
- Use correlation analysis to identify important variables.
- Construct new features based on domain knowledge (e.g., differences in gene expression, treatment combinations).
- Handle high-dimensional data through dimensionality reduction techniques (e.g., PCA or feature selection).

### 3. Model Training and Optimization
#### Objective:
- Train machine learning models to predict patient survival outcomes and optimize performance.

#### Specific Tasks:
- Experiment with various models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM).
- Evaluate generalization ability using cross-validation.
- Fine-tune hyperparameters using grid search or Bayesian optimization.

### 4. Model Integration
#### Objective:
- Combine multiple models to improve overall performance.

#### Specific Tasks:
- Apply simple weighted averaging or stacking methods.
- Compare the performance of different ensemble approaches to select the best strategy.

### 5. Results Analysis and Submission
#### Objective:
- Generate prediction files in the required format and analyze results.

#### Specific Tasks:
- Ensure predictions comply with competition guidelines.
- Analyze model errors and identify misclassified samples.
- Submit multiple attempts, including single models and ensembles.

### 6. Iteration and Improvement
#### Objective:
- Refine models and processes based on initial submissions and feedback.

#### Specific Tasks:
- Analyze public leaderboard results to identify weaknesses in the model.
- Further optimize feature engineering and hyperparameters.
